# RAG-Based Research Paper Chatbot

A smart AI chatbot that can answer questions about research papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.
(As of now I have fixed the research paper input in the topic that I'm currently researching on i.e Indivisible Fair Division)

## What This App Does ?

- **Document Analysis**: Upload and process research papers (PDF format) - As stated earlier the input of research paper is fixed here
- **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask questions about the paper content in natural language
- **Contextual Responses**: Get accurate answers with citations from the source document
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive web interface for seamless conversation

## üöÄ Core Functionality

1. **PDF Processing**: Automatically chunks and indexes research paper content
2. **Vector Search**: Uses ChromaDB for semantic document retrieval
3. **AI-Powered Responses**: Leverages OpenAI GPT-4 for generating contextual answers
4. **Citation Support**: Always provides references to specific parts of the document

## üí° What I Have Accomplished Through This

- Built a complete RAG pipeline from scratch using LangChain and LangGraph
- Created an intuitive web interface for non-technical users
- Implemented efficient document retrieval with vector embeddings
- Deployed a production-ready application with proper error handling
- Made research paper exploration accessible through conversational AI
